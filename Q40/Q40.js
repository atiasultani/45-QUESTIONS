// 40.	Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
//      The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object 
//      containing these two pieces of information. 
//      Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
//      Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. 
//      Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
//      If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, 
//      add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
