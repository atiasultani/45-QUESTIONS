// 25.	Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. 
//     Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
//     • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. 
//     If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
//     • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version  that fails will have no output.)

//version 1 if test is pass.
