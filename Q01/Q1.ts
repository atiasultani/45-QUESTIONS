// 3. Globally Installing TypeScript
// It can be handy to have TypeScript available across all projects, often to test one-off ideas. Long-term, codebases should prefer a project-wide installation over a global install so that they can benefit from reproducible builds across different machines.

// via npm
// You can use npm to install TypeScript globally, this means that you can use the tsc command anywhere in your terminal.

// To do this, run npm install -g typescript. This will install the latest version (currently 5.4).

// via Visual Studio Marketplace
// You can install TypeScript as a Visual Studio extension, which will allow you to use TypeScript across many MSBuild projects in Visual Studio.

// The latest version is available in the Visual Studio Marketplace.
